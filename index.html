        <h2>About Eco-Action Nursery Trust</h2>

        <p>We grow native trees and plants suitable for native bird food and habitat
            within the Christchurch Red-Zone.
            We cultivate plants sourced from the nearby Travis Wetlands in satellite
            nurseries managed by schools and community groups. Throughout the
            year, we run events planting and mulching within the Christchurch
            Red-Zone.
            In time, the plants we grow will form a corridor for native birds to return
            to the Christchurch city centre.</p>


        <br>
        <p> All seed grown is eco-sourced from the Travis Wetland area. Eco-sourcing enhances both survival and growth
            rates for local native plants. Seed collection permits are obtained from the Park Rangers Department of the
            Christchurch City Council.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Tree and plant choice is made to provide year around food to allow resident populations of White eye,
            Bellbird, Tui, and Kereru to flourish in what is currently an introduced plant desert that does not contain
            the nectar and soft fruit producing trees and shrubs native birds require.

            CCC Parks Ecologists have input as to species choice and location. Mulch is used to reduce weed growth, and
            optimize water retention.</p>
