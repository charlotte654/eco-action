    <h2>About Eco-Action Nursery Trust</h2>

    <h3>We grow native trees and plants suitable for native bird food and habitat
        within the Christchurch Red-Zone.
        We cultivate plants sourced from the nearby Travis Wetlands in satellite
        nurseries managed by schools and community groups. Throughout the
        year, we run events planting and mulching within the Christchurch
        Red-Zone.
        In time, the plants we grow will form a corridor for native birds to return
        to the Christchurch city centre.</h3>
