        <h2>WHAT HAVE WE DONE</h2>

        <p>Eco action was founded in 2016. We've since planted more than 42,000 plants, and continue to expand our
            capacity and membership with the help of the community. Eco-Action has established 23 satellite nurseries
            around Christchurch, and continue to establish more. With your help, we want to keep exploding the number of
            plantings we do every year, so that we, and those that come after us can enjoy a thriving environment.

            We've planted Akeake, Black seeded sedge, Cabbage tree, Carex secta, Coprosma propinqua, Coprosma, Robusta,
            Corokia cotoneaster, Five Finger, Flax cookianum, Flax Tenax, Giant Rush, Griselinia litoralis, Hebe
            koromiko, Hebe small leaf, Kahikatea, Kanuka, Kowhai microphylla, Kowhai prostrate, Lacebark, Horeria,
            Lancewood ferox, Lancewood straight, Lophomyrtus, Manuka, Marbleleaf, Muhlenbechia astonii, Mysine
            australis, Ngaio, Oleria paniculata, Pittosporum eugenoides, Pittosporum tenuifolium, Ribbonwood Plagianthus
            regius, Toitoi, Totara, Windgrass, and Wineberry.</p><br><br><br>


        <h2>PLAN FOR 2023</h2>

        <p>In 2023, we'll again be running four plantings, each with around 3000 plants being put in the ground. In
            addition, we'll be providing the city with even more plants than before, and we're considering expanding our
            plantings by enlisting local business to give a helping hand. A day out of the office might be nice. Please
            contact us to organise a planting day: ecoactionnt@gmail.com

            We'll be doubling our production of seedlings to a whopping 65,000 plants to prepare for 2024 and beyond.

            We hope you'll join us! Please keep in touch on our Facebook page.</p>

        <h2>HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2022</h2>

        <p>We planted 13,000 plants over four-ish planting days, and provided the city with a further 5500 plants that
            were
            planted around the Red Zone.

            We continued to ramp up production of seedlings so that we could meet our goal of planting 30,000 plants in
            2023. To achieve this, we now have two community groups and 21 satellite nursery schools growing plants. We
            introduced 70x70mm pots, to more efficiently cultivate fast growing species. We began work on a transit
            nursery
            to store the sheer volumes of plants we're growing. We began planting our important kahikatea and tōtara
            with
            1x1m weedmat to ensure their survival. We recorded several instructional videos to help our satellite
            nurseries
            produce healthy plants, and participate in more tasks.

            We also laid the ground work for new ways to move stuff around, to cope with all the plants.

            We received around $30,000 of funding from the CCC, anonymous donors, schools, and awards, which is all
            absolutely invaluable for our ever growing work. We were also given access to enough land by the CCC to
            continue
            our plantings into 2023.</p>
