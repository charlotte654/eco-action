    <h2>WHAT HAVE WE DONE</h2>

    <h3>Eco action was founded in 2016. We've since planted more than 42,000 plants, and continue to expand our
        capacity and membership with the help of the community. Eco-Action has established 23 satellite nurseries
        around Christchurch, and continue to establish more. With your help, we want to keep exploding the number of
        plantings we do every year, so that we, and those that come after us can enjoy a thriving environment.

        We've planted Akeake, Black seeded sedge, Cabbage tree, Carex secta, Coprosma propinqua, Coprosma, Robusta,
        Corokia cotoneaster, Five Finger, Flax cookianum, Flax Tenax, Giant Rush, Griselinia litoralis, Hebe
        koromiko, Hebe small leaf, Kahikatea, Kanuka, Kowhai microphylla, Kowhai prostrate, Lacebark, Horeria,
        Lancewood ferox, Lancewood straight, Lophomyrtus, Manuka, Marbleleaf, Muhlenbechia astonii, Mysine
        australis, Ngaio, Oleria paniculata, Pittosporum eugenoides, Pittosporum tenuifolium, Ribbonwood Plagianthus
        regius, Toitoi, Totara, Windgrass, and Wineberry.</h3>


    <h4>PLAND FOR 2023</h4>

    <h5>In 2023, we'll again be running four plantings, each with around 3000 plants being put in the ground. In
        addition, we'll be providing the city with even more plants than before, and we're considering expanding our
        plantings by enlisting local business to give a helping hand. A day out of the office might be nice. Please
        contact us to organise a planting day: ecoactionnt@gmail.com

        We'll be doubling our production of seedlings to a whopping 65,000 plants to prepare for 2024 and beyond.

        We hope you'll join us! Please keep in touch on our Facebook page.</h5>

    <h6>HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2022</h6>

    <h7>We planted 13,000 plants over four-ish planting days, and provided the city with a further 5500 plants that were
        planted around the Red Zone.

        We continued to ramp up production of seedlings so that we could meet our goal of planting 30,000 plants in
        2023. To achieve this, we now have two community groups and 21 satellite nursery schools growing plants. We
        introduced 70x70mm pots, to more efficiently cultivate fast growing species. We began work on a transit nursery
        to store the sheer volumes of plants we're growing. We began planting our important kahikatea and tōtara with
        1x1m weedmat to ensure their survival. We recorded several instructional videos to help our satellite nurseries
        produce healthy plants, and participate in more tasks.

        We also laid the ground work for new ways to move stuff around, to cope with all the plants.

        We received around $30,000 of funding from the CCC, anonymous donors, schools, and awards, which is all
        absolutely invaluable for our ever growing work. We were also given access to enough land by the CCC to continue
        our plantings into 2023.</h7>
